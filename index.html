            <p>
                I am a dedicated Computer Science major with three associate degrees in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics,
                which provide me with a strong interdisciplinary foundation. I have hands-on experience programming in Python, Java, and
                C++, developing practical problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of software development principles. I am characterized by an eagerness to learn and a proven ability to acquire new skills rapidly, enabling me to adapt
                effectively to evolving technological challenges and contribute meaningfully to collaborative projects. My dedication to
                continuous growth underscores my commitment to excellence in the field of computer science.
